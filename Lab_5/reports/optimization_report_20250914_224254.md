# Machine Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the outcome of a manufacturing optimization process involving the allocation of production demand across various machines, each with distinct capacities, variable costs, and fixed costs. The primary objective was to minimize the overall manufacturing cost while fulfilling a demand requirement of 3000 units.

The optimization achieved a final manufacturing cost of $19,300, marking a 6.76% improvement from the initial cost prediction of $20,700. This outcome was largely influenced by strategic allocations and expert recommendations considered throughout the iterations. Key recommendations emerging from this optimization include maximizing the utilization of machines with lower variable costs and reconsidering the role of high fixed-cost machines in future demand scenarios.

## Problem Analysis

The machines analyzed were as follows:

- **Tool_2**: Capacity 800 units, Variable Cost $3.0/unit, Fixed Cost $3000
- **Tool_6**: Capacity 1600 units, Variable Cost $3.0/unit, Fixed Cost $3000
- **Tool_13**: Capacity 2000 units, Variable Cost $5.0/unit, Fixed Cost $4500
- **Tool_25**: Capacity 600 units, Variable Cost $7.0/unit, Fixed Cost $2500

The demand requirement was to produce 3000 units efficiently. The optimization aimed to minimize costs while satisfying demand entirely, keeping in view the balance of variable and fixed costs.

## Optimization Process

The optimization reached convergence over 3 iterations. The stopping criterion was an expert consensus that validated the allocation as strategically optimal. Expert feedback from various domains shaped the optimization, focusing on cost reduction, machine efficiency, and better utilization.

Feedback focused on:
- Maximizing use of low variable cost machines
- Reassessing high fixed-cost machine utilization
- Exploring potential for cost reduction through specific demand allocations

## Results Analysis

The final optimal allocation was:
- **Tool_6**: 1600 units
- **Tool_13**: 1400 units

Total cost: $19,300, achieved with the cost-friendly allocation strategy suggested by experts. The initial allocation, majorly utilizing Tool_6, Tool_2, and Tool_13, had a cost of $20,700. This improvement in allocation strategy led to significant cost savings.

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Capacity Utilization:
  - Tool_6: 100%
  - Tool_13: 70%
- Cost per unit: Reduced, with a transitional focus on variable costs and rationalized fixed costs.
