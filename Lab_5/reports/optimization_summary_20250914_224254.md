# Manufacturing Optimization Report
*Generated on 2025-09-14 22:42:54*

## Executive Summary

The optimization process analyzed 4 machines to meet a demand of 3000 units.

**Key Results:**
- Final Cost: $19,300.00
- Total Iterations: 3
- Cost Improvement: 6.8%

## Final Allocation

| Machine | Units Allocated | Capacity Utilization |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Tool_6 | 1,600 | 100.0% |
| Tool_13 | 1,400 | 70.0% |
| Tool_2 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Tool_25 | 0 | 0.0% |

## Cost Analysis

**Final Cost Breakdown:**
- Tool_6: $4,800.00 (variable) + $3,000.00 (fixed) = $7,800.00
- Tool_13: $7,000.00 (variable) + $4,500.00 (fixed) = $11,500.00

**Total: $11,800.00 (variable) + $7,500.00 (fixed) = $19,300.00**

## Optimization Journey

| Iteration | Total Cost | Cost Change |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | $20,700.00 | Initial |
| 2 | $19,900.00 | $800.00 saved |
| 3 | $19,300.00 | $600.00 saved |

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track actual production costs against optimized allocation
2. **Capacity Planning**: Consider machine capacity constraints for future demand changes
3. **Continuous Optimization**: Re-run optimization when machine costs or capacities change
