# Manufacturing Optimization Strategies Knowledge Base

## Overview
This knowledge base contains proven optimization strategies for manufacturing allocation problems. Each strategy includes conditions for when to apply it, implementation steps, and expected outcomes.

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. COST MINIMIZATION STRATEGIES

#### Strategy: Variable Cost Optimization
**When to Apply:** When variable costs dominate total cost or when machines have significantly different per-unit costs
**Implementation:**
- Calculate variable cost per unit for each machine
- Rank machines by variable cost efficiency (lowest cost per unit first)
- Allocate to most efficient machines first until capacity is reached
- Only use higher-cost machines when necessary for demand fulfillment
**Expected Outcome:** Minimizes variable cost component of total cost
**Key Metrics:** Variable cost per unit, total variable cost

#### Strategy: Fixed Cost Consolidation  
**When to Apply:** When fixed costs are significant or when many machines have similar variable costs
**Implementation:**
- Calculate total cost per unit (variable + fixed/capacity) for each machine
- Prefer machines with lower total cost per unit
- Minimize number of machines activated to reduce fixed cost burden
- Maximize utilization of activated machines
**Expected Outcome:** Reduces total fixed costs by using fewer machines
**Key Metrics:** Number of machines used, utilization rates, fixed cost per machine

#### Strategy: Break-Even Analysis
**When to Apply:** When deciding between machines with different cost structures
**Implementation:**
- Calculate break-even volume for each machine: Fixed_Cost / (Price - Variable_Cost)
- For volumes above break-even, machine becomes more cost-effective
- Compare total costs at actual allocation volumes
- Choose machine combination that minimizes total cost at required volumes
**Expected Outcome:** Optimal machine selection based on actual production volumes
**Key Metrics:** Break-even volumes, total cost comparisons

### 2. EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

#### Strategy: Capacity Utilization Maximization
**When to Apply:** When wanting to get maximum value from machine investments
**Implementation:**
- Calculate utilization rate: Allocated_Units / Machine_Capacity
- Target 80-95% utilization on cost-effective machines
- Avoid over-allocation (>100% utilization)
- Balance utilization across similar-cost machines
**Expected Outcome:** Better return on machine investments
**Key Metrics:** Utilization percentages, capacity waste

#### Strategy: Bottleneck Management
**When to Apply:** When certain machines limit overall production efficiency
**Implementation:**
- Identify capacity-constrained machines
- Prioritize high-efficiency, high-capacity machines
- Use constrained machines at full capacity if cost-effective
- Distribute remaining demand across unconstrained machines
**Expected Outcome:** Eliminates production bottlenecks while minimizing cost
**Key Metrics:** Machine capacity constraints, production flow balance

### 3. BATCH OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

#### Strategy: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Principles
**When to Apply:** When setup costs or batch changeover costs are significant
**Implementation:**
- Calculate optimal batch sizes considering setup costs
- Minimize number of setups by using larger batches
- Balance setup costs against holding/production costs
- Prefer longer runs on single machines over frequent changeovers
**Expected Outcome:** Reduces setup and changeover costs
**Key Metrics:** Batch sizes, number of setups, setup cost per unit

#### Strategy: Machine Grouping
**When to Apply:** When machines have similar cost characteristics
**Implementation:**
- Group machines by cost efficiency levels
- Allocate within groups to minimize total cost
- Use highest efficiency group first, then move to next tier
- Maintain allocation balance within efficiency groups
**Expected Outcome:** Systematic cost optimization across machine portfolio
**Key Metrics:** Machine efficiency tiers, within-group allocation balance

### 4. DEMAND FULFILLMENT STRATEGIES

#### Strategy: Greedy Cost Allocation
**When to Apply:** When demand must be met at minimum cost
**Implementation:**
- Sort machines by total cost per unit (variable + fixed/capacity)
- Allocate demand to lowest-cost machine first
- Move to next lowest-cost machine when capacity reached
- Continue until demand is fully allocated
**Expected Outcome:** Meets demand at theoretical minimum cost
**Key Metrics:** Cost per unit ranking, total cost achieved

#### Strategy: Proportional Allocation
**When to Apply:** When balancing risk or maintaining operational flexibility
**Implementation:**
- Calculate cost-weighted allocation proportions
- Distribute demand proportionally based on cost efficiency
- Maintain minimum allocation levels for operational continuity
- Adjust proportions based on capacity constraints
**Expected Outcome:** Balanced allocation reducing operational risk
**Key Metrics:** Allocation proportions, risk distribution

### 5. ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES

#### Strategy: Cost Gap Analysis
**When to Apply:** When current allocation is suboptimal
**Implementation:**
- Calculate marginal cost difference between machines
- Identify high-cost allocations that could be shifted
- Propose specific unit transfers from high-cost to low-cost machines
- Verify capacity constraints allow the transfer
**Expected Outcome:** Incremental cost improvements through reallocation
**Key Metrics:** Marginal cost differences, potential cost savings

#### Strategy: Sensitivity Analysis
**When to Apply:** When validating allocation robustness
**Implementation:**
- Test allocation changes of ±10% on each machine
- Calculate cost impact of small allocation shifts
- Identify machines where small changes yield large cost improvements
- Recommend adjustments based on sensitivity analysis
**Expected Outcome:** Fine-tuned allocation with validated cost optimality
**Key Metrics:** Cost sensitivity coefficients, optimal adjustment ranges

## APPLICATION FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
- Identify demand requirements
- Catalog machine capabilities and constraints
- Calculate cost structures (variable, fixed, total)
- Determine optimization priorities (cost vs. efficiency vs. risk)

### Step 2: Strategy Selection
- Choose 2-3 most relevant strategies based on problem characteristics
- Consider constraint severity and cost structure dominance
- Prioritize strategies by expected impact

### Step 3: Implementation
- Apply selected strategies systematically
- Calculate expected outcomes for each strategy
- Compare results and select best approach
- Verify constraint compliance

### Step 4: Validation & Refinement
- Check mathematical accuracy of calculations
- Verify demand fulfillment and capacity constraints
- Apply iterative improvement strategies if needed
- Document reasoning and trade-offs made

## COMMON OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Cost-Dominated Scenarios
Use Variable Cost Optimization → Fixed Cost Consolidation → Cost Gap Analysis

### Pattern 2: Capacity-Constrained Scenarios  
Use Bottleneck Management → Capacity Utilization Maximization → Proportional Allocation

### Pattern 3: Balanced Optimization Scenarios
Use Greedy Cost Allocation → Break-Even Analysis → Sensitivity Analysis

### Pattern 4: Complex Multi-Objective Scenarios
Use Machine Grouping → EOQ Principles → Iterative Improvement

## DECISION RULES

### When to Prioritize Variable Cost Optimization:
- Variable costs > 60% of total cost
- Significant (>20%) difference in variable costs between machines
- High-volume production scenarios

### When to Prioritize Fixed Cost Optimization:
- Fixed costs > 40% of total cost
- Many machines with similar variable costs
- Ability to significantly reduce number of machines used

### When to Apply Iterative Improvement:
- Initial allocation shows suboptimal patterns
- Marginal cost differences > 5% between machines
- Capacity utilization is unbalanced (some <50%, others >90%)

### Red Flags Requiring Strategy Change:
- Allocation exceeds machine capacity constraints
- Demand not fully met
- Cost calculations show mathematical errors
- Utilization patterns create operational risks
