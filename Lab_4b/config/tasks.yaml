allocation_task:
  description: >
    You are tasked with finding the optimal machine allocation to minimize total manufacturing cost.
    
    CURRENT PROBLEM:
    - Total demand: {demand} units
    - Available machines: {machines}
    - Current iteration: {iteration}
    
    MACHINE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL):
    - Tool_784: MAX 1900 units
    - Tool_801: MAX 900 units  
    - Tool_311: MAX 500 units
    WARNING: Exceeding capacity will result in automatic correction by the system!
    
    LEARNING FROM PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS:
    - Previous attempts: {previous_attempts}
    - Strategist feedback from last iteration: {strategist_feedback_history}
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. If this is NOT iteration 0, you MUST analyze the strategist feedback and improve your allocation
    2. Focus on cost minimization above all else while meeting demand and capacity constraints
    3. NEVER exceed machine capacities - your allocation will be automatically corrected
    4. Show your step-by-step mathematical calculations for cost optimization
    5. Learn from strategist recommendations and incorporate their suggested optimization strategies
    6. If strategist suggested specific changes, implement them and explain why
    
    ALLOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
    - Meet exactly {demand} units of demand
    - Do not exceed any machine's capacity (see constraints above)
    - Minimize total cost (variable costs + fixed costs for used machines)
    - Show detailed cost calculations for your chosen allocation
    
    RESPONSE FORMAT:
    Provide your allocation as a structured response with:
    - allocation: dict mapping machine names to production units
    - total_cost: calculated total cost
    - reasoning: detailed explanation of your optimization approach and how you incorporated strategist feedback
    - iteration: current iteration number

  expected_output: >
    A structured allocation result with machine assignments, total cost, detailed reasoning 
    showing cost calculations and how strategist feedback was incorporated, and iteration number.
